# Cycle Generative Adversarial Nets for Style Transfer of Monet Paintings

This project implements Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) to perform style transfer, transforming images to emulate the style of Monet's paintings.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Vision and Cognitive System course at the University of Padua, Computer Science Master's Degree program. The goal is to apply CycleGANs for artistic style transfer, specifically focusing on Monet's painting style. This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition [I'm Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started).
